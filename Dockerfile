# Multi-arch: BuildKit auto-populates TARGETARCH (amd64 / arm64). s6-overlay
# uses tarball names keyed on the kernel arch string (x86_64 / aarch64), so
# we map between them inline. The noarch + symlinks tarballs are
# architecture-independent and reused as-is.
#
# We use `curl` instead of `ADD` for the per-arch tarball because `ADD`
# evaluates its URL at parse time, before any ARG / TARGETARCH substitution
# — splitting one URL per arch into two ADDs would download both on every
# build and leave dead bytes in the cache. A single curl + arch-keyed URL
# is simpler and cache-friendlier.
#
# Supply-chain integrity: every tarball is checksum-verified against the
# upstream-published SHA256. To bump S6_OVERLAY_VERSION, fetch the four
# `.sha256` files from the corresponding release and update the ARGs. The
# checksum lookup happens during build, so a compromised release artifact
# fails the build loudly instead of silently producing a tampered image.

# frontend stats the readme path during dep resolution, so we `touch` an
# empty placeholder — the real README is restored by `COPY . .` below.
#
# `uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --extra all --extra messaging`
# installs the deps reachable through the composite `[all]` extra
# (handpicked set intended for the production image — excludes `[dev]`),
# plus gateway messaging adapters that should work in the published image
# without a first-boot lazy install.  We do NOT use `--all-extras`:
# that would pull in `[rl]` (atroposlib + tinker + torch + wandb from
# git), `[yc-bench]` (another git dep), and `[termux-all]` (Android
# redundancy), none of which belong in the published container.
#
# Provider packages (anthropic, bedrock, azure-identity) are included
# so Docker users can use these providers without requiring runtime
# lazy-install access to PyPI (often blocked in containerized envs).
#
# The hindsight memory provider's client (hindsight-client) is baked in
# for the same reason: it lazy-installs into /opt/hermes/.venv at first
# use, which lives inside the (immutable) image layer rather than the
# mounted /opt/data volume, so it is lost on every container recreate /
# image update and recall/retain then fails with
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hindsight_client'` (#38128).
#
# The Matrix gateway's deps ([matrix] extra) are baked in because
# python-olm (transitive via mautrix[encryption]) builds from source on
# Python/image combinations without usable wheels.  The Docker image is
# Linux-only, so keeping the native libolm/build-toolchain packages here
# avoids the cross-platform failures that kept [matrix] out of [all]
# while still making Matrix work in the published container. Fixes #30399.

# The ``.install_method`` stamp is baked next to the running code (the install
# tree), NOT into $HERMES_HOME. $HERMES_HOME (/opt/data) is a shared data
# volume that is commonly bind-mounted from the host and even shared with a
# host-side Desktop/CLI install; stamping it at boot used to clobber that
# host install's marker and wrongly block its ``hermes update``. A code-scoped
# stamp is read first by detect_install_method() and is immune to the share.
# Start as root so the s6-overlay stage2 hook can usermod/groupmod and chown
# the data volume. Each supervised service then drops to the hermes user via
# `s6-setuidgid hermes` in its run script. If HERMES_UID is unset, services
# run as the default hermes user (UID 10000).

# ---------- Bake build-time git revision ----------
# .dockerignore excludes .git, so `git rev-parse HEAD` from inside the
# container always returns nothing — meaning `hermes dump` reports
# "(unknown)" and the startup banner drops its `· upstream <sha>` suffix.
# That makes support triage from container bug reports impossible:
# we can't tell which commit the user is actually running.
#
# Fix: write the commit SHA passed via the HERMES_GIT_SHA build-arg to
# /opt/hermes/.hermes_build_sha at build time, and have
# hermes_cli/build_info.py read it at runtime.  Both `hermes dump` and
# banner.get_git_banner_state() try the baked SHA first, then fall back
# to live `git rev-parse` for source installs (unchanged behaviour).
#
# The arg is optional — local `docker build` without --build-arg simply
# omits the file, and the runtime falls back to live-git lookup.  CI
# (.github/workflows/docker.yml) passes ${{ github.sha }} so
# every published image has it.

# _tui_need_npm_install / runtime `npm install` branch entirely — exactly the
# nix/packaged-release path the launcher was designed for.
#
# Why this is required (not just an optimization): the root package-lock.json
# describes the WHOLE monorepo workspace set (root + web + ui-tui + apps/*),
# but the image only installs root/web/ui-tui (apps/* — the desktop app — is
# never `npm install`ed here). So the actualized node_modules permanently
# disagrees with the canonical lock, _tui_need_npm_install() returns True on
# every launch, and the runtime `npm install` it triggers (a) can never
# converge against the partial monorepo and (b) races itself across concurrent
# embedded-chat (/api/pty) connections → ENOTEMPTY → the chat tab dies with a
# 502 / "[session ended]". Pointing at the prebuilt bundle sidesteps the whole
# check. (A separate launcher hardening is tracked independently.)

# Redirect those lazy installs to a writable dir on the durable data volume.
# lazy_deps appends this dir to the END of sys.path, so a package installed
# here can only ADD modules — it can never shadow or downgrade a core module,
# so the sealed-venv guarantee holds even with installs re-enabled. The dir
# is seeded + chowned to the hermes user by docker/stage2-hook.sh and lives

# The shim lives at /opt/hermes/bin/hermes, sits earliest on PATH, and

# when invoked as root. Non-root callers (supervised processes,

#
