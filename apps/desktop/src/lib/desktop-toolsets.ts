// desktop-specific filter — so it surfaces entries that don't belong in a flat
// per-user toggle list on the desktop: platform-coupled toolsets (which
// `hermes tools` already platform-restricts on the CLI) and internal plumbing
// that isn't a user-facing capability. Mirror the curation approach used for
// slash commands (`desktop-slash-commands.ts`): one documented block-list, one
// predicate. Hiding a toolset only removes its row — its enabled state and
// runtime gating are untouched.
