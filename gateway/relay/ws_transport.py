"""Production WebSocket RelayTransport — the gateway's live link to the connector.

The gateway dials OUT to the connector's relay endpoint over a WebSocket and
speaks the newline-delimited JSON frame protocol defined in the connector repo
(``gateway-gateway`` ``src/relay/protocol.ts``) and mirrored in
``docs/relay-connector-contract.md``:

  gateway -> connector : hello, outbound, interrupt
  connector -> gateway : descriptor, inbound, outbound_result, interrupt_inbound

Frames:
  hello            {type, platform, botId}
  descriptor       {type, descriptor}                       (handshake reply)
  inbound          {type, event, bufferId?}                 (a normalized MessageEvent)
  outbound         {type, requestId, action}                (send/edit/typing/follow_up)
  outbound_result  {type, requestId, result}
  interrupt        {type, session_key, reason?}             (gateway egresses /stop)
  interrupt_inbound{type, session_key, chat_id}             (connector -> owning gateway)

This is the concrete transport behind the ``RelayTransport`` Protocol; the
``RelayAdapter`` delegates all wire I/O to it. Outbound calls block on a
per-request future keyed by ``requestId`` until the matching ``outbound_result``
arrives. A background reader task pumps inbound frames to the registered handler
and resolves pending outbound futures.

EXPERIMENTAL: the frame schema may change without a deprecation cycle until at
least two Class-1 platforms validate it.

          - ``disconnect()`` sets ``_closing=True`` and CANCELS the reconnect
            supervisor — terminal, "shutting down for good." A machine suspended
            after that never re-dials on wake, so its buffered backlog strands.
          - An unexpected close re-dials IMMEDIATELY (fast backoff) — the socket
            never stays down, so the platform proxy never sees the connection go
            away and never suspends the machine.

        ``go_dormant()`` is the third mode the suspend behaviour needs:
          1. ``go_idle()`` → the connector flips this instance to buffered-only
             and acks (so inbound that arrives while we sleep buffers durably and
             replays on the next handshake).
          2. Close the socket so the platform proxy sees load drop to zero (the
             precondition for Fly ``autostop:"suspend"``) — but WITHOUT setting
             ``_closing``. The reader's normal end-of-socket fall-through still
             arms the reconnect supervisor, so the wake path stays live; the
             ``_dormant`` flag just makes that supervisor poll on the dormant
             cadence rather than fight the suspend window.

        On resume (process unfrozen) the supervisor's pending wait completes, the
        re-dial succeeds, and the connector drains the buffered backlog on the new
        handshake. Returns the ``go_idle`` ack result (True on ack); the dormancy
        close happens regardless (a missed ack at worst races one live event onto
        a closing socket, exactly as §5.3 already tolerates).

        No-op-safe: a transport that never connected (``_ws is None``) just
        returns False without closing.
