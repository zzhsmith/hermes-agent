"""RelayAdapter — one generic gateway adapter fronted by the connector. EXPERIMENTAL.

A single ``BasePlatformAdapter`` subclass that, at handshake, receives a
``CapabilityDescriptor`` from the connector telling it which platform it is
fronting and which capabilities to advertise to the ``GatewayStreamConsumer``.
It implements the four abstract methods (``connect`` / ``disconnect`` / ``send``
/ ``get_chat_info``) plus the capability surface (``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH``,
``message_len_fn``, ``supports_draft_streaming``) by delegating wire I/O to an
injected transport and reading capabilities off the descriptor.

There is NO per-platform gateway code: the connector is the only side that knows
"this chat_id maps to a Discord channel, send it via the Discord websocket."
The gateway sees an ordinary ``MessageEvent`` in and calls ``adapter.send`` out.

EXPERIMENTAL: the transport protocol and descriptor schema may change without a
deprecation cycle until >=2 Class-1 platforms validate them.
