"""External drain-control marker contract (dashboard → gateway).

Task 2.2 of the safe-shutdown plan (decisions.md Q-B, option A): the dashboard
has no way to call into a running gateway — there is no HTTP control channel
into the gateway process (guardrails: "there is NO external control channel
into a running gateway"). Restart/drain is driven only by the gateway reacting
to its own inputs: slash commands, process signals, and file markers it writes
itself (``.restart_notify.json``).

So the begin/cancel-drain dashboard endpoint communicates with the running
gateway the same way: it writes (or removes) a marker file, and a gateway
background watcher reacts to it. This module owns that marker contract so both
sides — the dashboard endpoint (writer) and the gateway watcher (reader) —
share one definition and can never disagree.

Contract (presence-based, mirroring ``.restart_notify.json``):

  * begin-drain  → write ``{HERMES_HOME}/.drain_request.json`` with
    ``{"action": "drain", "requested_at": <iso>, "principal": <str>,
    "epoch": <instantiation-epoch>}``.
  * cancel-drain → remove the marker.
  * The gateway watcher treats **presence of a marker stamped with the current
    instantiation epoch** as "external drain active": flip
    ``gateway_state -> "draining"`` and stop accepting new turns. Absence (or a
    marker from a *prior* instantiation) means "not draining" (revert to
    ``running`` if we had flipped it).

Why the epoch (NS-570). ``HERMES_HOME`` is a **durable** store — on Hermes
Cloud it is a persistent Fly volume (``/opt/data``). A begin-drain marker
written there *survives a machine restart*. But the disruptive lifecycle
actions a drain protects (auto-update / image migrate / env edit / profile
change) all **restart the machine**, which is exactly the signal that the drain
is over. Without the epoch, a freshly-restarted gateway re-reads the orphaned
marker on boot and parks itself right back in ``draining`` forever (NS-570: an
auto-updated instance refused every turn for ~52 min). Stamping the marker with
an identity of *this* container/VM instantiation, and ignoring a marker whose
epoch doesn't match, makes "a deliberate restart clears the drain" true by
construction — while a marker written during the *current* instantiation (the
live drain) still matches, and an s6 respawn of just the gateway (PID 1 / init
unchanged) still honours an in-flight drain.

Reading the marker never raises: a malformed/half-written file reads as
"present but contentless", which the watcher still treats as drain-active
(fail-safe toward quiescing — a corrupt begin marker must not be ignored). The
epoch check is deliberately **lenient**: it ignores a marker only on a
*definite* epoch mismatch. A marker with no epoch (legacy/corrupt/contentless),
or an environment where the epoch cannot be computed (non-Linux, no ``/proc``),
both degrade to the original presence-only behaviour — never fail-closed.

    """Identity of THIS container / VM instantiation.

    Stable for the life of the PID-1 init process — so an s6 respawn of just
    the gateway keeps the same epoch and an in-flight drain is honoured — but
    changes when the machine/container is recreated (a fresh PID 1 → a fresh
    epoch). Composed from two ``/proc`` facts:

      * the kernel **boot id** (``/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id``) — changes
        on a VM / microVM reboot (e.g. a Fly Firecracker machine restart);
      * **PID 1's start time** (field 22 of ``/proc/1/stat``) — changes on a
        plain ``docker restart`` (the host kernel, hence boot_id, is unchanged,
        but ``/init`` is a brand-new process).

    Together they discriminate every restart mode that matters:

      | event                          | boot_id | pid1 start | epoch  | marker |
      |--------------------------------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
      | Fly microVM reboot (auto-upd.) | changes | changes    | NEW    | reject |
      | plain ``docker restart``       | same    | changes    | NEW    | reject |
      | s6 respawn of the gateway only | same    | same       | SAME   | honour |
      | host ``hermes gateway restart``| same    | same(init) | SAME   | honour |

    The last row is intentional: a host install has no durable-volume drain
    bug, and honouring a drain across a deliberate process restart is the
    intended reversible behaviour (D4a) — PID 1 there is the long-lived init
    (systemd/launchd), so the epoch is stable.

    Returns ``""`` when neither identity source is readable (non-Linux, no
    ``/proc``). An empty epoch disables the staleness check downstream,
    degrading to the released presence-only behaviour — never fail-closed.
    Memoised: the epoch is constant for the life of the process.
