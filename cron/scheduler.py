    ``CronPromptInjectionBlocked`` when a match fires so ``run_job`` can
    surface a clear refusal to the operator.

    Plugs the #3968 gap: ``_scan_cron_prompt`` runs on the user-supplied
    prompt at create/update, but skill content is loaded from disk at
    runtime and was never scanned. Since cron runs non-interactively
    (auto-approves tool calls), a malicious skill carrying an injection
    payload bypassed every gate.

    Two pattern tiers, selected by what the assembled prompt CONTAINS,
    not just whether skills are attached:

    - When the assembled prompt is essentially the user prompt + the cron
      hint (no skills, no injected data), the STRICT ``_scan_cron_prompt``
      patterns apply: a bare ``rm -rf /`` in a small directive prompt is a
      smoking gun, not prose.
    - When the assembled prompt includes runtime-loaded content — skill
      markdown (``has_skills=True``) or DATA injected from a job script's
      stdout / an upstream job's output (``has_injected_data=True``) — the
      LOOSER ``_scan_cron_skill_assembled`` pattern set is used: only
      unambiguous prompt-injection directives block; command-shape
      patterns are dropped and invisible unicode is sanitized (stripped +
      logged) rather than blocked, to avoid false-positives that
      permanently kill a job. Skill bodies are vetted at install time by
      ``skills_guard.py``; script output is produced by operator-authored
      code, the same trust class — and data feeds (e.g. a triage bot
      ingesting bug reports) legitimately quote dangerous commands.

    When the looser tier is selected because of injected data only,
    ``user_prompt`` (the raw, pre-assembly prompt) is additionally scanned
    with the STRICT set so the user-authored surface keeps the full
    create/update-time guarantee at runtime (defense-in-depth for legacy
    jobs that predate the create-time scanner).
