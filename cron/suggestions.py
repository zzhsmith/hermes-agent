"""Suggested cron jobs — proposed automations the user accepts with one tap.

A *suggestion* is a ready-to-run cron job spec that Hermes surfaces to the
user, who accepts it (creates the real cron job) or dismisses it (latched so
it is never re-offered). This is the single surface every automation proposal
flows through, regardless of where it came from:

  * ``catalog``  — a curated starter automation (daily briefing, important-mail
                   monitor, weekly digest, ...).
  * ``blueprint``   — the user installed a skill that carries a ``blueprint:`` block
                   (see ``tools/blueprints.py``); installing it registers a
                   suggestion instead of auto-scheduling.
  * ``usage``    — the background self-improvement review noticed a recurring
                   ask that a scheduled job would serve.
  * ``integration`` — the user connected an account (Gmail, GitHub, ...) and
                   the obvious automations for that surface are offered.

Accepting a suggestion just calls the existing ``cron.jobs.create_job`` with
the stored ``job_spec`` — there is NO second job engine. Suggestions never
auto-create jobs; acceptance is always explicit (consent-first). Dismissed
suggestions latch by a stable ``dedup_key`` so the same proposal is not
re-offered after the user says no.

Storage mirrors ``cron/jobs.py``: ``~/.hermes/cron/suggestions.json``, atomic
writes, an in-process lock, and 0600 perms.
