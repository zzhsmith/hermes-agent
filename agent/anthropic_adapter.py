# ── Anthropic thinking-mode classification ────────────────────────────
# Claude 4.6 replaced budget-based extended thinking with *adaptive* thinking,
# and 4.7 additionally forbids the manual ``thinking`` block entirely and drops
# temperature/top_p/top_k.  Newer Claude releases (4.8, and named models like
# claude-fable-5) follow the same modern contract — but they share no common
# version substring, so an allowlist of version numbers ("4.6", "4.7", …) goes
# stale the moment a model ships without a recognized number and silently
# routes it down the legacy manual-thinking path.
#
# Instead we DEFAULT unknown Claude models to the modern contract and keep an
# explicit *legacy* list of the older Claude families that still require manual
# thinking.  This mirrors _get_anthropic_max_output's "default to newest" design
# (future models are unlikely to regress to the older contract), so each new
# Claude release works without a code change.
#
# Non-Claude Anthropic-Messages models (minimax, qwen3, GLM, …) are NOT Claude,
# so they fall through to the legacy path automatically — exactly what those
# manual-thinking endpoints need.

    """Build kwargs for anthropic.messages.create().

    Naming note — two distinct concepts, easily confused:
      max_tokens     = OUTPUT token cap for a single response.
                       Anthropic's API calls this "max_tokens" but it only
                       limits the *output*.  Anthropic's own native SDK
                       renamed it "max_output_tokens" for clarity.
      context_length = TOTAL context window (input tokens + output tokens).
                       The API enforces: input_tokens + max_tokens ≤ context_length.
                       Stored on the ContextCompressor; reduced on overflow errors.

    When *max_tokens* is None the model's native output ceiling is used
    (e.g. 128K for Opus 4.6, 64K for Sonnet 4.6).

    When *context_length* is provided and the model's native output ceiling
    exceeds it (e.g. a local endpoint with an 8K window), the output cap is
    clamped to context_length − 1.  This only kicks in for unusually small
    context windows; for full-size models the native output cap is always
    smaller than the context window so no clamping happens.
    NOTE: this clamping does not account for prompt size — if the prompt is
    large, Anthropic may still reject the request.  The caller must detect
    "max_tokens too large given prompt" errors and retry with a smaller cap
    (see parse_available_output_tokens_from_error + _ephemeral_max_output_tokens).

    When *is_oauth* is True, applies Claude Code compatibility transforms:
    system prompt prefix, tool name prefixing, and prompt sanitization.

    When *preserve_dots* is True, model name dots are not converted to hyphens
    (for Alibaba/DashScope anthropic-compatible endpoints: qwen3.5-plus).

    When *base_url* points to a third-party Anthropic-compatible endpoint,
    thinking block signatures are stripped (they are Anthropic-proprietary).

    When *fast_mode* is True, adds ``extra_body["speed"] = "fast"`` and the
    fast-mode beta header for ~2.5x faster output throughput on Opus 4.6.
    Currently only supported on native Anthropic endpoints (not third-party
    compatible ones).
