    conversation flow, but flatten it into clean user/assistant *text* turns:

      - system prompt: dropped (8K of Hermes boilerplate, not advisory signal).
      - assistant turns: kept; any ``tool_calls`` are rendered inline as
        ``[called tool: name(args)]`` text lines appended to the turn's text.
      - ``tool``-role results: NOT dropped. Each is folded (head+tail preview,
        see ``_truncate_tool_result``) into the *preceding* assistant turn as a
        ``[tool result: ...]`` block, so the reference sees what came back.

    This emits ZERO ``tool``-role messages and ZERO ``tool_calls`` arrays — only
    plain user/assistant text — so strict providers (Mistral, Fireworks) that
    reject orphan tool messages / unproduced tool_calls don't 400, while the
    reference still has the full picture.

    The view MUST end with a ``user`` turn. Anthropic (and OpenRouter→Anthropic)
    interpret a trailing assistant turn as an assistant *prefill* to continue,
    and no-prefill models (e.g. Claude Opus 4.8) reject it with
    ``400 ... must end with a user message``. Rather than DELETE the agent's
    latest context to satisfy that (which would blind the reference to the
    current state), we APPEND a synthetic user turn asking the reference to
    judge the state above. End-on-user is satisfied and no context is lost.
