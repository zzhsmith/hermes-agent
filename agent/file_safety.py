        carrier.
      * Credential / secret stores under HERMES_HOME and the global Hermes
        root: ``auth.json``, ``auth.lock``, ``.anthropic_oauth.json``,
        ``.env``, ``webhook_subscriptions.json``, ``auth/google_oauth.json``,
        and anything under ``mcp-tokens/``. These hold plaintext provider keys,
        OAuth tokens, and HMAC secrets that the agent never needs to read
        directly — provider tools / gateway adapters consume them through
        internal channels.
      * Project-local environment files anywhere on disk: ``.env``,
        ``.env.local``, ``.env.development``, ``.env.production``,
        ``.env.test``, ``.env.staging``, ``.envrc``. These routinely hold
        API keys, database passwords, and other credentials for the user's
        own projects. The agent helping debug a project shouldn't normally
        need to read these — ``.env.example`` is the documented-shape
        substitute.

    **This is NOT a security boundary.** The terminal tool runs as the
    same OS user with shell access; the agent can still ``cat auth.json``
    or ``cat ~/.hermes/.env`` and exfiltrate the file. The read-deny exists
    as defense-in-depth that:

      * Returns a clear error to models that respect tool denials, which
        empirically prompts most modern models to stop rather than reach
        for the shell.
      * Surfaces a visible audit trail when something tries to read
        credentials — easier to spot in logs than a generic ``cat``.

    Treat any user-visible framing around this as "may help" rather than
    "stops attackers." A determined model or malicious instruction can
    always shell out.

    Callers that resolve relative paths against a non-process cwd
    (e.g. ``TERMINAL_CWD`` in ``tools/file_tools.py``) MUST pre-resolve
    and pass the absolute path string.  This function's own ``resolve()``
    is anchored at the Python process cwd, so a relative input like
    ``"auth.json"`` would otherwise miss the denylist when the task's
    terminal cwd differs from the process cwd.

# Container-context mirror guard (inner-container case — #32049 follow-up)
#
# Brian's shape-based detector (#32213) catches paths that still carry the
# full ``…/sandboxes/<backend>/<task>/home/.hermes/…`` prefix on the host.
# But when file tools execute *inside* the container the bind-mount strips
# that prefix: the agent sees plain ``/root/.hermes/…``.  The root:root
# ownership on the divergent SOUL.md in #32049 confirms this is the primary
# failure mode.
#
# Fix: file_tools passes the active Docker mirror prefix when the terminal
# backend is docker + persistent. This catches the very first file-tool call,
# before a DockerEnvironment object necessarily exists.
