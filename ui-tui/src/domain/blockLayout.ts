 * Visual group a transcript block belongs to. Blocks in the same group render

 * trails (or model paragraphs) reads as one section and the eye only catches a
 * gap where the *kind* of content actually changes — the boundary between
 * reasoning/tool trails, model prose, and notes/errors.
 *
 *   user   — the human turn (owns its separator + margins in MessageLine)
 *   model  — assistant prose, the model's voice
 *   trail  — reasoning + tool-call trails (the agent's working area)
 *   note   — system notes and errors (a quieter band)
 *   diff   — inline patch segments (an island, owns its own margins)
 *   slash  — slash-command echoes (owns its margin)
 *   intro  — banner / panels (rendered out-of-band, never gapped here)
