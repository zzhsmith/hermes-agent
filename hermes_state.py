"""
SQLite State Store for Hermes Agent.

Provides persistent session storage with FTS5 full-text search, replacing
the per-session JSONL file approach. Stores session metadata, full message
history, and model configuration for CLI and gateway sessions.

Key design decisions:
- WAL mode for concurrent readers + one writer (gateway multi-platform)
- FTS5 virtual table for fast text search across all session messages
- Compression-triggered session splitting via parent_session_id chains
- Batch runner and RL trajectories are NOT stored here (separate systems)
- Session source tagging ('cli', 'telegram', 'discord', etc.) for filtering

    # new). That mutation is local to the AIAgent instance — but ``state.db``

    # only catches one rotation; the other child silently accumulates
    # writes — Damien's "parent → two orphan children" repro shape.

        Full-text search across session messages using FTS5.

        Supports FTS5 query syntax:
          - Simple keywords: "docker deployment"
          - Phrases: '"exact phrase"'
          - Boolean: "docker OR kubernetes", "python NOT java"
          - Prefix: "deploy*"

        Returns matching messages with session metadata, content snippet,
        and surrounding context (1 message before and after the match).

        ``sort`` controls temporal ordering:
          - ``None`` (default): FTS5 BM25 relevance only. Time-neutral.
          - ``"newest"``: order by message timestamp DESC, then by rank.
          - ``"oldest"``: order by message timestamp ASC, then by rank.

        The short-CJK LIKE fallback already orders by timestamp DESC and
        ignores ``sort``. The trigram CJK path honours ``sort`` like the main
        FTS5 path.

        Rewound (``active=0``, ``compacted=0``) rows are excluded by default —
        the user took those back. Compaction-archived rows (``active=0``,
        ``compacted=1``) ARE included by default: they were summarized away from
        the live context but remain part of the conversation's record, so the
        pre-compaction transcript stays discoverable after in-place compaction
        (#38763). Pass ``include_inactive=True`` to search every row regardless.

        freed pages just get reused on the next insert. After a prune that
        removed hundreds of sessions, the file stays bloated unless we
        explicitly VACUUM.

        VACUUM rewrites the entire DB, so it's expensive (seconds per
        100MB) and cannot run inside a transaction. It also acquires an
        exclusive lock, so callers must ensure no other writers are
        active. Safe to call at startup before the gateway/CLI starts
        serving traffic.

        FTS5 segments are merged first via :meth:`optimize_fts` so the
        subsequent VACUUM reclaims the pages freed by the merge. This is a
        layout-only optimization — search results are unchanged.
