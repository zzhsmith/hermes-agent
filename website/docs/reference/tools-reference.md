# Built-in Tools Reference

This page documents Hermes' built-in tools, grouped by toolset. Availability varies by platform, credentials, and enabled toolsets.

**Quick counts (current registry):** ~71 tools — 10 browser tools (core) + 2 CDP-gated browser tools, 4 file tools, 4 Home Assistant tools, 2 terminal tools, 2 web tools, 5 Feishu tools, 7 Spotify tools (registered by the bundled `spotify` plugin), 5 Yuanbao tools, 9 kanban tools (registered when the kanban dispatcher spawns the agent), 2 Discord tools, and a handful of standalone tools (`memory`, `clarify`, `delegate_task`, `execute_code`, `cronjob`, `session_search`, `skill_view`/`skill_manage`/`skills_list`, `text_to_speech`, `image_generate`, `video_generate`, `vision_analyze`, `video_analyze`, `send_message`, `todo`, `computer_use`, `process`).

:::tip MCP Tools
In addition to built-in tools, Hermes can load tools dynamically from MCP servers. MCP tools appear with the prefix `mcp_<server>_` (e.g., `mcp_github_create_issue` for the `github` MCP server). See [MCP Integration](/user-guide/features/mcp) for configuration.

## `browser` toolset (CDP-gated tools)

These two tools live in the `browser` toolset but only register when a Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint is reachable at session start — via `/browser connect`, `browser.cdp_url` config, a Browserbase session, or Camofox.

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `browser_cdp` | Send a raw Chrome DevTools Protocol command. Escape hatch for browser operations not covered by the higher-level `browser_*` tools. See https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/ | CDP endpoint |
| `browser_dialog` | Respond to a native JavaScript dialog (alert / confirm / prompt / beforeunload). Call `browser_snapshot` first — pending dialogs appear in its `pending_dialogs` field. Then call `browser_dialog(action='accept'\|'dismiss')`. | CDP endpoint |

## `clarify` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `clarify` | Ask the user a question when you need clarification, feedback, or a decision before proceeding. Supports two modes: 1. **Multiple choice** — provide up to 4 choices. The user picks one or types their own answer via a 5th 'Other' option. 2.… | — |

## `code_execution` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|

## `delegation` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `delegate_task` | Spawn one or more subagents to work on tasks in isolated contexts. Each subagent gets its own conversation, terminal session, and toolset. Only the final summary is returned -- intermediate tool results never enter your context window. TWO… | — |

## `image_gen` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `image_generate` | Generate images from text prompts (text-to-image) or edit/transform an existing image (image-to-image) via the user-configured backend (FAL.ai, OpenAI, xAI, Krea). Pass `image_url` to edit an image and `reference_image_urls` for style references; omit both for text-to-image. The model is user-configured and not selectable by the agent. Returns a single image URL or local path. | FAL_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / xAI OAuth / KREA_API_KEY |

## `kanban` toolset

Registered when the agent is either (a) spawned by the kanban dispatcher (`HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` env set) or (b) running in a profile that explicitly enables the `kanban` toolset. Task-scoped workers use lifecycle tools for their assigned task; orchestrator profiles additionally get board-routing tools like `kanban_list` and `kanban_unblock`. See [Kanban Multi-Agent](/user-guide/features/kanban) for the full workflow.

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|

| `terminal` | Execute shell commands on a Linux environment. Filesystem persists between calls. Set `background=true` for long-running servers. Set `notify_on_complete=true` (with `background=true`) to get an automatic notification when the process finishes — no polling needed. Do NOT use cat/head/tail — use read_file. Do NOT use grep/rg/find — use search_files. | — |

## `todo` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `todo` | Manage your task list for the current session. Use for complex tasks with 3+ steps or when the user provides multiple tasks. Call with no parameters to read the current list. Writing: - Provide 'todos' array to create/update items - merge=… | — |

## `vision` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `vision_analyze` | Analyze images using AI vision. On vision-capable main models, returns the raw image pixels as a multimodal tool result so the model sees them natively on its next turn. On text-only main models, falls back to an auxiliary vision model that describes the image and returns the description as text. Tool signature is identical either way. | — |

## `video` toolset

Opt-in toolset (not loaded in the default `hermes-cli` set). Add via `--toolsets video` or include `video` in your `toolsets:` config.

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `video_analyze` | Analyze video content from a URL or file path — captions, scene breakdowns, key timestamps, and visual descriptions. | — |

## `video_gen` toolset

Opt-in toolset (not loaded in the default `hermes-cli` set). Add via `--toolsets video_gen` or enable it in `hermes tools` → Video Generation, which also walks you through picking a backend.

Backends ship as plugins under `plugins/video_gen/<name>/`:

- **xAI Grok-Imagine** — text-to-video and image-to-video (SuperGrok OAuth or `XAI_API_KEY`).
- **FAL.ai** — Veo 3.1, Pixverse v6, Kling O3 (requires `FAL_KEY`).

The single `video_generate` tool covers both modalities — pass `image_url` to animate a still, omit it to generate from text alone. The active backend auto-routes to the right endpoint. The tool's description is rebuilt at session start to reflect the active backend's actual capabilities (modalities, aspect ratios, resolutions, duration range, max reference images, audio support). See [Video Generation Provider Plugins](/developer-guide/video-gen-provider-plugin) for backend authoring.

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `video_generate` | Generate a video from a text prompt (text-to-video) or animate a still image (image-to-video) using the user's configured video generation backend. Pass `image_url` to animate that image; omit it to generate from text alone. The backend auto-routes to the right endpoint. Returns either an HTTP URL or an absolute file path in the `video` field. | Active `video_gen` plugin + its credential (e.g. `XAI_API_KEY`, `FAL_KEY`) |

## `web` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `web_search` | Search the web for information. Returns up to 5 results by default with titles, URLs, and descriptions. Accepts an optional `limit` (1-100, default 5). The query is passed through to the configured backend, so operators such as `site:domain`, `filetype:pdf`, `intitle:word`, `-term`, and `"exact phrase"` may work when the backend supports them. | EXA_API_KEY or PARALLEL_API_KEY or FIRECRAWL_API_KEY or TAVILY_API_KEY |
| `web_extract` | Extract content from web page URLs. Returns page content in markdown format. Also works with PDF URLs — pass the PDF link directly and it converts to markdown text. Pages under 5000 chars return full markdown; larger pages are LLM-summarized. | EXA_API_KEY or PARALLEL_API_KEY or FIRECRAWL_API_KEY or TAVILY_API_KEY |

## `x_search` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `x_search` | Search X (Twitter) posts, profiles, and threads using xAI's built-in `x_search` Responses tool. Use this for current discussion, reactions, or claims on X rather than general web pages. Off by default — opt in via `hermes tools` → 🐦 X (Twitter) Search. Schema is only registered when xAI credentials are configured (check_fn-gated). | XAI_API_KEY **or** xAI Grok OAuth (SuperGrok / Premium+) login |

## `tts` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `text_to_speech` | Convert text to speech audio. Returns a MEDIA: path that the platform delivers as a voice message. On Telegram it plays as a voice bubble, on Discord/WhatsApp as an audio attachment. In CLI mode, saves to ~/voice-memos/. Voice and provider… | — |

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `discord_admin` | Manage a Discord server via the REST API: list guilds/channels/roles, create/edit/delete channels, manage role grants, timeouts, kicks, and bans. | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + bot permissions |

## `spotify` toolset
