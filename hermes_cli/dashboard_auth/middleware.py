"""Auth-gate middleware for the dashboard.

Engaged when ``app.state.auth_required is True``. The gate's job:

  1. Allow a small set of routes through unauthenticated (login page,
     ``/auth/*`` OAuth round trip, ``/api/auth/providers``, static
     assets).
  2. For everything else, demand a valid session cookie and attach the
     verified :class:`Session` to ``request.state.session``.
  3. On HTML routes, redirect missing/invalid cookies to ``/login``.
     On ``/api/*`` routes, return 401 JSON.

The middleware is a no-op when ``auth_required`` is False (loopback
mode); the legacy ``_SESSION_TOKEN`` ``auth_middleware`` handles those
binds.
