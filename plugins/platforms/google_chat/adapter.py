"""
Google Chat platform adapter.

Uses Google Cloud Pub/Sub (pull subscription) for inbound events and the
Google Chat REST API for outbound messages. Pattern parallels Slack Socket
Mode and Telegram long-polling: no public endpoint required.

Concurrency model
-----------------
The Pub/Sub SubscriberClient invokes its message callback in a background
thread (managed by the client's internal executor). The adapter's
``handle_message`` coroutine must run on the asyncio event loop, so the
callback uses ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` with
``add_done_callback`` (never ``.result()`` — that would block the callback
thread and saturate the Pub/Sub executor under load).

All outbound Chat REST calls go through ``asyncio.to_thread`` because the
googleapiclient is synchronous. This keeps the event loop responsive.

Pub/Sub delivery diagram::

    Pub/Sub stream   ->  callback thread        ->  asyncio loop
    (streaming_pull)     (_on_pubsub_message)       (handle_message)
         |                       |                        |
         |   at-least-once       |  parse + dedup         |  agent work
         |   delivery            |  _submit_on_loop       |  send() response
         |                       |  message.ack()         |
         v                       v                        v

Event type routing
------------------
Inbound envelope carries ``type`` in [MESSAGE, ADDED_TO_SPACE, REMOVED_FROM_SPACE,
CARD_CLICKED]. Only MESSAGE dispatches to the agent. ADDED_TO_SPACE caches the
bot's resource name (belt-and-suspenders on top of eager resolution in connect()).
CARD_CLICKED is ACK'd only in v1 (follow-up PR implements interactivity).

             returns 401 for SA bearer tokens) and is unlikely to work,
             but we keep the path for forward-compat with Google changes.

        with the real response (no deletion tombstone). The typing card is
        either patched by ``send()`` (success) or by
        ``on_processing_complete`` (failure / cancellation).

        IMPORTANT — must place the typing card in the user's thread:
        ``messages.patch`` cannot change a message's ``thread`` (it's
        immutable on update). If we create the typing card at top-level

        IMPORTANT — cancellation safety:
        ``base.py``'s ``_keep_typing`` calls this through
        ``asyncio.wait_for(send_typing, timeout=1.5)``. When the

        sees an empty slot and creates a SECOND card. Result: one orphan
        "Hermes is thinking…" stuck in chat forever, plus one card that

        agent's reply. Deleting the marker creates a "Message deleted by
        its author" tombstone, which is visual noise.

        Upstream code (gateway/run.py and gateway/platforms/base.py) calls
        ``stop_typing`` at three moments per turn — typically BEFORE

        when the slot holds a real ``message_name``: the card is left in
        place so ``send()`` can patch it.

        Three cases:
