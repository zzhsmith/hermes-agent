"""Tests for /learn — open-ended skill distillation.

Covers the shared prompt builder (agent.learn_prompt.build_learn_prompt) and
the slash-command registry wiring. /learn has no engine and no model tool: it
builds a standards-guided prompt that the live agent runs as a normal turn, so
these are the load-bearing behavior contracts.
