"""Harness: per-profile gateway start/stop inside the container.

Phase 4 wires `hermes -p <profile> gateway start/stop` through the s6
ServiceManager dispatch path inside the container — so the lifecycle
commands now bring up an s6-supervised gateway rather than refusing
with the pre-Phase-4 informational message.

These tests were marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` through Phase 0–3 and
flip to plain ``test_…`` once Phase 4 lands (now).

NB: The harness profile has no model/auth configured. Depending on
how the gateway run script handles missing config, the supervised
process may either spin up successfully (and svstat reports ``up``)
or exit fast and get throttled by s6 (and svstat reports ``down …,
want up``). Both states are valid "user asked for gateway up" results
— what we assert is the *want* intent the lifecycle command set, NOT
the supervised process's health. ``s6-svc -u`` records ``want up`` in
the supervise/status file regardless of the run-script outcome.

Every ``docker exec`` here runs as the unprivileged ``hermes`` user
(via :func:`docker_exec_sh` in conftest); see the conftest module
docstring.
