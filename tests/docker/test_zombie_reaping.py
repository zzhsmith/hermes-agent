"""Harness: PID 1 must reap orphaned zombie processes.

tini (current PID 1) reaps zombies via its built-in subreaper behavior.
s6-overlay's ``/init`` (Phase 2 PID 1) does the same. This invariant is
required for long-running containers spawning subprocesses (subagents,
dashboard, dynamic gateways) — otherwise the process table fills with
defunct entries and eventually exhausts the kernel PID space.

Every ``docker exec`` here runs as the unprivileged ``hermes`` user
(via :func:`docker_exec_sh` in conftest); see the conftest module
docstring.
