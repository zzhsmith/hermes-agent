"""Harness: `docker run <image> gateway run` redirects to supervised mode.

Before the s6 migration, ``docker run nousresearch/hermes-agent gateway
run`` was the standard pattern — the gateway ran as the container's
main process, container exit code matched gateway exit code, no
supervision. With s6 as PID 1, the same invocation now auto-redirects
to the supervised path (`gateway start`) so users get auto-restart on
crash and a supervised dashboard alongside (when ``HERMES_DASHBOARD=1``).

These tests verify the three load-bearing properties of that redirect:

  1. The default invocation **does** redirect (container stays up via
     ``sleep infinity`` while s6 supervises ``gateway-default``).
  2. ``--no-supervise`` / ``HERMES_GATEWAY_NO_SUPERVISE=1`` opts out.
  3. The supervised process itself does NOT recurse — the
     ``HERMES_S6_SUPERVISED_CHILD`` sentinel breaks the loop.

Every ``docker exec`` runs as ``hermes`` per the conftest module
docstring; see ``tests/docker/conftest.py`` for rationale.
