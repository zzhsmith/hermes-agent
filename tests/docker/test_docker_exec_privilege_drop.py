"""Regression tests for the docker-exec privilege-drop shim.

The shim (docker/hermes-exec-shim.sh, installed at /opt/hermes/bin/hermes)
exists to prevent the auth.json ownership-mismatch bug where
`docker exec <c> hermes login` would write /opt/data/auth.json as
root:root mode 0600, leaving the supervised gateway (UID 10000) unable
to read its own credentials and returning "Provider authentication
failed: Hermes is not logged into Nous Portal" on every message.

These tests verify:

1. ``docker exec <c> hermes …`` (defaulting to root) gets dropped to the
   hermes user before the real binary runs.
2. ``docker exec --user hermes <c> hermes …`` (already non-root) short-
   circuits and doesn't try to drop again.
3. Files written under $HERMES_HOME from a ``docker exec`` session land
   as hermes:hermes — the actual user-visible invariant.
4. The HERMES_DOCKER_EXEC_AS_ROOT opt-out lets diagnostic sessions keep
   running as root deliberately.
5. The main CMD path (``docker run <image> …``) is unaffected by the
   PATH-shim ordering — no recursion, no behavior change.

    The earlier ``_wait_for_init`` only polled ``docker exec <c> true``,

    ``01-hermes-setup`` cont-init hook (docker/stage2-hook.sh) has
    finished seeding + ``chown hermes:hermes`` config.yaml and running the
    Python config migration. A test that wipes config.yaml and then writes
    it as root would then race that boot-time chown: on native amd64
    stage2-hook wins in a blink and the test always passed, but under arm64
    QEMU emulation the slow Python migration was still in flight and
    clobbered the root-written file's ownership back to hermes:hermes,
    failing ``test_shim_opt_out_keeps_root`` non-deterministically.

    The reliable "cont-init is done" signal is
    ``$HERMES_HOME/logs/container-boot.log``: it is written by
    ``02-reconcile-profiles`` (hermes_cli.container_boot), which s6 runs
    *strictly after* ``01-hermes-setup`` in lexicographic order. The
    reconciler always logs at least one ``profile=default`` line even for a
    bare ``sleep infinity`` container, so once that marker appears every
    stage2-hook side effect (seed, chown, migrate) is guaranteed complete.
