    """Regression tests for unescaping common sequences in new_string when
    the matched region of the file contains real control characters.

    Issue #33733: LLMs overwhelmingly represent tabs as the two-character
    sequence ``\\t`` (backslash + t) in JSON tool-call arguments. When the
    file already contains real tab bytes (0x09), writing new_string
    verbatim leaves literal ``\\t`` characters and corrupts the file.

    The fix unescapes ``\\t`` -> tab and ``\\r`` -> CR in new_string when
    the matched file region actually contains those control characters,
    regardless of which match strategy fired. ``\\n`` is excluded because
    newlines serialize correctly through JSON.
