"""
Lazy dependency installer for opt-in Hermes Agent backends.

Many Hermes features (Mistral TTS, ElevenLabs TTS, Honcho memory, Bedrock,
Slack, Matrix, etc.) require Python packages that not every user needs. The
historical approach was to bundle them all under ``pyproject.toml`` extras
(``hermes-agent[all]``) and install them eagerly at setup time. That has
two problems:

1. **Fragility.** When one extra's transitive dependency becomes
   unavailable on PyPI (quarantined for malware, yanked, broken upload),
   the *entire* ``[all]`` resolve fails and fresh installs silently fall
   back to a stripped tier — losing 10+ unrelated extras at once.

2. **Bloat.** A user who only ever talks to one provider pulls hundreds
   of packages they will never import.

The lazy-install pattern fixes both. Backends call :func:`ensure` at the
top of their first-import path. If the deps are missing, ``ensure`` checks
the ``security.allow_lazy_installs`` config flag (default true) and runs
a venv-scoped pip install. If the user has explicitly disabled lazy
installs, ``ensure`` raises :class:`FeatureUnavailable` with a clear
remediation hint pointing at ``hermes tools`` or the manual pip command.

Security model:

* **Venv-scoped by default.** Installs target ``sys.executable`` in the
  active venv. We never touch the system Python.
* **Durable-target mode (immutable images).** When the deployment seals the
  agent's own venv (the Docker image sets ``HERMES_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALLS=1``
  and makes ``/opt/hermes`` read-only), setting
  ``HERMES_LAZY_INSTALL_TARGET`` redirects lazy installs to a writable
  directory on the durable data volume (e.g. ``/opt/data/lazy-packages``).
  That directory is **appended to the end of ``sys.path``** — never
  prepended, never exported via ``PYTHONPATH`` — so the agent's own
  site-packages wins every name collision. A package installed this way can
  only ADD new importable modules; it can never shadow, downgrade, or break
  a module the core already ships. The worst a bad/incompatible backend
  package can do is fail to import and report itself unavailable — the agent
  core stays healthy. This is the structural guarantee that a lazily
  installed package cannot brick Hermes, which is what made it safe to seal
  the venv in the first place. Compiled-wheel safety across image rebuilds
  is handled by an ABI/Python-version stamp on the target subdir (see
  :func:`_ensure_target_ready`).
* **PyPI by package name only.** Specs may be ``"package>=1.0,<2"`` etc.
  We do NOT support ``--index-url`` overrides, ``git+https://``, file:
  paths, or any other input that could be hijacked by a malicious config.
* **Allowlist.** Only specs that appear in :data:`LAZY_DEPS` can be
  installed via this path. A typo in feature name doesn't get the user
  install-anything semantics.
* **Opt-out.** Setting ``security.allow_lazy_installs: false`` in
  ``config.yaml`` disables runtime installs in BOTH modes. Users in
  restricted networks or strict security postures can pin themselves to
  whatever was installed at setup time.
* **Offline detection.** If the install fails (offline, mirror down,
  PyPI 404 / quarantine), we surface the failure as
  :class:`FeatureUnavailable` with the actual pip stderr — no silent
  retries, no caching of bad state.

Adding a new backend:

1. Add an entry to :data:`LAZY_DEPS` with the package specs.
2. At the top of the backend module's import path, call
   ``ensure("feature.name")`` inside a try/except that converts
   :class:`FeatureUnavailable` to a useful runtime error.
