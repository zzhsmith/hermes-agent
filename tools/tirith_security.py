"""Tirith pre-exec security scanning wrapper.

Runs the tirith binary as a subprocess to scan commands for content-level
threats (homograph URLs, pipe-to-interpreter, terminal injection, etc.).

Exit code is the verdict source of truth:
  0 = allow, 1 = block, 2 = warn

JSON stdout enriches findings/summary but never overrides the verdict.
Operational failures (spawn error, timeout, unknown exit code) respect
the fail_open config setting. Programming errors propagate.

Auto-install: if tirith is not found on PATH or at the configured path,
it is automatically downloaded from GitHub releases to $HERMES_HOME/bin/tirith.
The download always verifies SHA-256 checksums.  When cosign is available on
PATH, provenance verification (GitHub Actions workflow signature) is also
performed.  If cosign is not installed, the download proceeds with SHA-256
verification only — still secure via HTTPS + checksum, just without supply
chain provenance proof.  Installation runs in a background thread so startup
never blocks.
