"""
Process Registry -- In-memory registry for managed background processes.

Tracks processes spawned via terminal(background=true), providing:
  - Output buffering (rolling 200KB window)
  - Status polling and log retrieval
  - Blocking wait with interrupt support
  - Process killing
  - Crash recovery via JSON checkpoint file
  - Session-scoped tracking for gateway reset protection

Background processes execute THROUGH the environment interface -- nothing
runs on the host machine unless TERMINAL_ENV=local. For Docker, Singularity,
Modal, Daytona, and SSH backends, the command runs inside the sandbox.

Usage:
    from tools.process_registry import process_registry

    # Spawn a background process (called from terminal_tool)
    session = process_registry.spawn(env, "pytest -v", task_id="task_123")

    # Poll for status
    result = process_registry.poll(session.id)

    # Block until done
    result = process_registry.wait(session.id, timeout=300)

    # Kill it
    process_registry.kill(session.id)

        ``expected_start`` is the kernel start time captured when we spawned the

        recycled onto an unrelated process and we refuse to touch it, so a stale
        background-session PID can never tree-kill a browser or other stranger.

        POSIX: walks the process tree with ``psutil`` and SIGTERMs
        children before the parent so subprocess trees (e.g. Chromium
        renderers/GPU helpers spawned by an ``agent-browser`` daemon)
        don't get reparented to init and survive cleanup.  After a bounded
        grace window (``terminal.daemon_term_grace_seconds``) any tree member
        that ignored SIGTERM — a daemon stalled in its signal handler — is
        escalated to SIGKILL so it can't leak indefinitely.  Set the grace to
        0 to disable escalation (SIGTERM only).

        Windows: shells out to ``taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F``. This is
        the documented Microsoft primitive for tree-kill and matches the
        existing convention in ``gateway.status.terminate_pid``.  ``/F`` is
        already a hard kill, so no separate escalation step is needed.  We
        can't reuse the POSIX psutil path on Windows because:

          1. Windows doesn't maintain a Unix-style process tree —
             ``psutil.Process.children(recursive=True)`` walks PPID
             links that go stale when intermediate processes exit, so
             enumeration is best-effort and misses orphaned descendants.
          2. ``psutil.Process.terminate()`` on Windows is
             ``TerminateProcess()`` which kills only the target handle
             and is a hard kill — there is no Windows equivalent of a
             SIGTERM that cascades through a process group. (See the
             warning in ``gateway/status.py::terminate_pid``: "os.kill
             with SIGTERM is not equivalent to a tree-killing hard stop"
             on Windows.) Headless Chromium has no GUI window, so the
             softer ``taskkill /T`` without ``/F`` won't reach it either.

        ``psutil`` is a hard dependency (see ``pyproject.toml``); the
        bare-``os.kill`` fallback covers OSError / PermissionError on
        POSIX and a missing ``taskkill.exe`` on Windows (effectively
        unreachable on real Windows installs, but cheap insurance).
